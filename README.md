# LatexBuilder 📄

**LatexBuilder** is a simple and easy to use CLI tool that allows you to generate .tex files from user defined templates. 🛠
You can create your own templates using JSON. 


LatexBuilder will then parse your template and generate a .tex file that you can compile with your preferred LaTeX engine. LatexBuilder is ideal for creating reports, presentations, papers, and other documents that follow a similar structure and style. 📚

## Usage 🖥

- Download the source code and compile it or download the binaries 
- From a terminal of your choice launch the program using the following arguments: 

`./LatexBuilder.exe <template> <name> <path>` where
- _\<template\>_ is the name of the template 
- _\<name\>_ is the name of the file to be created 
- _\<path\>_ is the directory where the program will be saved 

## Templates 📐

On **Windows** the templates are stored in `C:/Users/Public/Documents/LatexBuilder/`

On **Linux** the templates are stored in `/home/.LatexBuilder/`

**JSON** is used to store templates.
