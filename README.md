# LatexBuilder

**LatexBuilder** is a simple and easy to use CLI tool that allows you to generate .tex files from user defined templates.
You can create your own templates using JSON.


LatexBuilder will then parse your template and generate a .tex file that you can compile with your preferred LaTeX engine. LatexBuilder is ideal for creating reports, presentations, papers, and other documents that follow a similar structure and style.

## Usage
On **Windows**:

- Download the source code and compile it using make or download the binaries
- From a terminal of your choice launch the program using the following arguments:

`./LatexBuilder.exe <template> <name> <path>` where
- _\<template\>_ is the name of the template
- _\<name\>_ is the name of the file to be created
- _\<path\>_ is the directory where the program will be saved

On **Linux**:

The linux version will come out soon! Sit tight!
